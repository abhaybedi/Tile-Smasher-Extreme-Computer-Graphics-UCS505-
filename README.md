**Brick Breaker Game in C++ with OpenGL**

This project represents my submission for a Computer Graphics project, implementing a classic Brick Breaker game in C++ with the OpenGL graphics library. The game features a dynamic ball, a movable paddle, and a wall of breakable bricks. I designed this project to showcase my skills in graphics programming and game development.

**Key Features:**

1. **Graphics and UI:**
   - Utilizes OpenGL for rendering graphics, providing an engaging gaming experience.
   - Displays the game window with a dynamic ball, a movable paddle, and a wall of breakable bricks.
   - A sidebar shows real-time information such as score, remaining chances, previous score, and highest score.

2. **Gameplay:**
   - Implements collision detection algorithms for interactions between the ball, paddle, and bricks.
   - Scoring system with points awarded for each brick hit and a gradual increase in ball speed as the player progresses.
   - Allows control of the paddle using the keyboard arrow keys and initiates the ball's movement with a left-click.

3. **Brick Layout:**
   - Generates a grid of bricks at the start, forming a challenging obstacle for the player.
   - Visually appealing display with colorful bricks that disappear upon impact.

4. **Challenges and Lives:**
   - Life system with a limited number of chances to prevent the ball from falling off the screen.
   - Game over messages and prompts to start a new game upon completion or failure.

5. **Scoring and Progression:**
   - Tracks the player's score throughout the game and updates the highest score achieved.
   - Stage completion messages and accelerated ball speed as the player reaches specific score milestones.

6. **User Interaction:**
   - Offers mouse-based controls, allowing the player to choose when to start the game and additional functionality with the right mouse button.

**How to Play:**
   1. Use the left and right arrow keys to move the paddle.
   2. Left-click to launch the ball and start the game.
   3. Break all the bricks to progress through stages and achieve a higher score.
   4. Keep an eye on the sidebar for real-time updates on score, chances, and highest score.

**Note:** The game window size is 760x480 pixels.
